# Organisation of your github repo

### Setup 

* Private
* Invite your supervisors, and, if you like, peers
* Keep it organized

### Issues

* **All** communication is via issues. **Do not use email.** Use @name to make sure the person for whom an issue is important gets a notification, or simply assign it.
* Close issues when they are over. Split them, if they become to crowded.
* Use the [project board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to get a good overview of your issues. 

### Main code folder

Most likely your data is too large to store on github, so store it elsewhere. If possible on some accesible place.

* Of course a helpful `README.md`
* Some must have folders are contained in two main sections.
* **Content**
    1. Thesis
        * Containing all Latex source files
    2. Thesis Design
    3. Related work
        4. PDFs
        5. Literature overview
        6. How your work is positioned in the literature
* **Research**
    1. Exploratory_Data_Analysis
        * Sample data file for playing around and trying things out
        * Notebook(s) doing EDA on your data
        * Notebook doing all the data pre-processing
    2. Experiments
        * Notebook(s) containing experiments with outcomes
        * Notebook(s) for hyperparameter tuning
        * Notebook(s) for setting up train/test if needed
    3. Analysis
        * Basis for your result section.
        * Eg, notebook(s) with significance testing, error analysis, insightfull plots and tables
        *
